End: Wed Oct 09 2024 11:30:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)
Description: Many of our students have real-world experiences that could translate into course credit. MSU Denver offers students the option to complete Prior Learning Assessments (PLA) through a compiled portfolio, where we determine if their experiences meet the standards of our classes. Would you like to learn what this process is and how to help students gain course credit in this manner?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>The PLA process fits perfectly with the MSU Denver Mission and helps meet students where they are to complete their programs and graduate in a timely manner. It is a cost effective way to help students succeed.&#160;The process is not as difficult or time-consuming as you think!<br><br>Led by Rebecca Trammell and&#160;Allison Lemmertz
